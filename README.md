# ðŸ“š libft â€“ 42 School's Custom C Library

![42 Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/42-Libft-blue)
*A foundational project from 42 School where we recreate essential C standard library functions from scratch.*

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

**libft** is a custom C library that reimplements several standard **libc** functions (like `strlen`, `strlcpy`, `calloc`, etc.), along with additional utility functions to work with strings, memory, and linked lists.

While this project originates from the 42 School curriculum, this repository also includes **personal extensions** to the library â€” functions that go beyond the original scope of the assignment.

These additions serve to enhance the library as a general-purpose C toolkit for future personal and academic projects.
