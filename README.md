## ðŸš€ Overview

**libft** is a custom C library that reimplements several standard **libc** functions (like `strlen`, `strlcpy`, `calloc`, etc.), along with additional utility functions to work with strings, memory, and linked lists. This library serves as a **personal toolkit** for future 42 projects.
